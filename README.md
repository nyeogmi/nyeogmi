# Hey, it's Nyeogmi!

Hey! I'm a programmer from the US. I've written code for a bunch of real-life stuff, some of which you might have even used.

## Model libraries

Rather than keeping a snippets file, I build "model libraries." These are libraries that happen to exist in one language, but are small enough and well-tested-enough to be feasibly ported to another programming language by one person.

## Misc libraries

## Not in progress 

I list stuff in here if I'm not actively working on it and it's not finished, but it's interesting and I think other people might find it instructive.

## Garbage dump

I only list stuff here if I think it would have basically zero value to other people.
